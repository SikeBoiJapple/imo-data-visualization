This project analyzes results from the **International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO)** to uncover trends in participation, performance, and score distributions across countries and years.  
The analysis is implemented in R Markdown and presented both as source code (`.Rmd`) and a rendered HTML report with plots and commentary.
